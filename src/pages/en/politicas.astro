          Reservations are finalized upon receipt of confirmation from Finca
          Casiana via email or WhatsApp, which will be made after receipt of the
          deposit.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-base md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-stone-600">
          Your reservation is guaranteed until check-in time on the day of your
          arrival. After that time, your guarantee will be lost and the cabin
          may be reassigned.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-base md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-stone-600">
          The refund of the deposit is subject to Finca Casiana's ability to
          reassign the cabin to another guest.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-base md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-stone-600">
          Extending your stay: Once you have booked your stay with us, you can
          extend it (subject to availability) simply by notifying us before your
          arrival. If you are already staying with us and wish to extend your
          stay, please notify us at least 24 hours before your departure date.
          We will do our best to accommodate your new plans, which may include
          relocating you to a similar apartment if necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-base md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-stone-600">
          The number of people staying in the cabins must be the same as
          confirmed in the reservation. The accommodation of additional guests
          is subject to our prior authorization and compliance with the
          conditions we inform you of. We reserve the right to cancel any
          reservation, without refund, if an unconfirmed number of people stay
          in the cabins.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-base md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-stone-600">
          Pets are allowed in the cabins and the complex, subject to prior
          authorization from Finca Casiana and under the conditions established.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-base md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-stone-600">
          Bedding and towels should be placed where they were originally found.

          Finca Casiana is not responsible for personal belongings lost or

          The cabins, as well as the common areas, all equipment, and
          furnishings, must be treated with care and kept in order. The tenant
          is financially responsible for any damage. This includes losses caused
          by negligent actions and behavior of the tenant or a third party. A
          summary inspection will be conducted at the time of departure from the
          apartment. However, a more detailed inspection of the condition of the
          cabins and all equipment and facilities will be conducted shortly
          after departure and before another guest occupies the apartment. The
          tenant is responsible for any damage or breakage found that exceeds
          normal wear and tear. In this case, a detailed statement of the damage
          will be sent immediately via email or WhatsApp, along with an invoice
          for the cost of repair or replacement.
